                <h2>Hi there! My name is Yvette and welcome to my learning journal.</h2>
                <p>After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer 
                    Career Path, I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp 
                    to get expert code reviews of my Solo Projects projects 
                    and meet like-minded peers.</p>

            <h3>How I stay committed to learning</h3>
            <p>I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to 
                spend hours and hours learning, then try to create simple 
                projects using what I learned or work new techniques into 
                existing projects.</p>
            <p>While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to 
                share what I was learning and most things about my journey 
                with the world.</p>

            <h3>How I got started</h3>
            <p>I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal 
                site. I would take notes about what I was learning. After 
                each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only 
                reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries 
                of what I learned using my own words.</p>
            <p>That helped me grasp what I was learning, and I realized 
                that posting my learning summaries was also helping 
                others learn and stay motivated.</p>
